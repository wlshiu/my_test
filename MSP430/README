This project contains a function to caluculate sine and cosine using CORDIC 
rotation on a 16 bit MSP430. The function takes any angle in degrees and 
outputs the answers in Q.15 fixed point format.
(floating point) = (fixed point)/ 2^15

In creating this file, I referenced the 2004 presentation of Fixed Point Two's 
Complement CORDIC Arithmetic on MSP430 presentation by Titi Trandafir of 
Microtrend Systems which contained an assembly language program utilizing 
CORDIC. Presentation available here: www.microtrendsys.com/ATC2004.pdf 
I also referenced the CORDIC wikipedia page.

The function internally utilizes the following decimal angle representation:
(decimal angle) = 2^16 * (integer angle in degrees) / 180

I tested the function using 14 iterations and achieved accuracy to 3-4 decimal
places. On an 8MHz chip, the algorithm took 256us to calculate sine/cosine for
angles in the range greater than -180 to 180 degrees. If you constrain the input
angles to -45 to 45 degrees and remove all the logic for greater angles, the 
CORDIC iterations are finished in 178us.

The file "MSP430 CORDIC Accuracy.xlsx" is a dump of the results of the algorithm
for angles in the range of -90 to 90.
