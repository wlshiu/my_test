/* VLDM Encoding T1 and T2

      Floating-point Load Multiple loads multiple extension registers from consecutive memory locations using an
      address from an ARM core register.

where :
            <mode>              The addressing mode:

                                    IA    Increment After. The consecutive addresses start at the address specified in <Rn>. This
                                          is the default and can be omitted. Encoded as P = 0, U = 1.

                                    DB    Decrement Before. The consecutive addresses end just before the address specified in

            <Rn>.               Encoded as P = 1, U = 0.

            <c>, <q>            See Standard assembler syntax fields on page A7-175.

            <size>              An optional data size specifier. If present, it must be equal to the size in bits, 32 or 64, of the registers
                                in <list>.

            <Rn>                The base register. The SP can be used.
            !                   Causes the instruction to write a modified value back to <Rn>. This is required if <mode> == DB, and
                                is optional if <mode> == IA. Encoded as W = 1.
                                If ! is omitted, the instruction does not change <Rn> in this way. Encoded as W = 0.

            <list>              The extension registers to be loaded, as a list of consecutively numbered registers, separated by
                                commas and surrounded by brackets. It is encoded in the instruction by setting D and Vd to specify
                                the first register in the list, and imm8 to the number of registers in the list. <list> must contain at
                                least one register.
