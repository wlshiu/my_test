/* VCVT, VCVTR (between floating-point and integer)

    Floating-point Convert (between floating-point and integer) converts a value in a register from floating-point to a
    32-bit integer, or from a 32-bit integer to floating-point, and places the result in a second register.

    The fixed-point value can be 16-bit or 32-bit. Conversions from fixed-point values take their operand from the
    low-order bits of the source register and ignore any remaining bits. Signed conversions to fixed-point values
    sign-extend the result value to the destination register width. Unsigned conversions to fixed-point values
    zero-extend the result value to the destination register width.
