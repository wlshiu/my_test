/* VSTM Encoding T1 and T2

      Floating-point Store Register stores a single extension register to memory, using an address from an ARM core
      register, with an optional offset.

          <Dd>                        The source floating-point register for a doubleword store.

          <Sd>                        The source floating-point register for a singleword store.

          <Rn>                        The base register. The SP can be used.

          +/-                         Is + or omitted if the immediate offset is to be added to the base register value (add == TRUE), or â€“ if
                                      it is to be subtracted (add == FALSE). #0 and #-0 generate different instructions.

          <imm>                       The immediate offset used to form the address. Values are multiples of 4 in the range 0-1020. <imm>
                                      can be omitted, meaning an offset of +0.
