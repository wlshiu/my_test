/* VSTM Encoding T1 and T2

    Floating-point Store Multiple stores multiple extension registers to consecutive memory locations using an address
    from an ARM core register.

    VSTM{mode}<c> <Rn>{!}, <list>               <list> is consecutive 64-bit registers

31 30 29 28 27 26 25 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
|1  1  1  0| 1  1  0|P   U  D W   0|     Rn    |     Vd    | 1  0 1 1|      imm8     |

where :
            <mode>              The addressing mode:

                                    IA Increment After.       The consecutive addresses start at the address specified in <Rn>. This
                                                              is the default and can be omitted. Encoded as P = 0, U = 1.

                                    DB Decrement Before.      The consecutive addresses end just before the address specified in

            <Rn>.               Encoded as P = 1, U = 0.

            <c>, <q>            See Standard assembler syntax fields on page A7-175.

            <size>              An optional data size specifier. If present, it must be equal to the size in bits, 32 or 64, of the registers
                                in <list>.

            <Rn>                The base register. The SP can be used.

            !                   Causes the instruction to write a modified value back to <Rn>. Required if <mode> == DB. Encoded
                                as W = 1.
                                If ! is omitted, the instruction does not change <Rn> in this way. Encoded as W = 0.

            <list>              The floating-point registers to be stored, as a list of consecutively numbered doubleword (encoding
                                T1) or singleword (encoding T2) floating-point registers, separated by commas and surrounded by
                                brackets. It is encoded in the instruction by setting D and Vd to specify the first floating-point
                                register in the list, and imm8 to twice the number of floating-point registers in the list (encoding T1)
                                or the number of floating-point registers (encoding T2). <list> must contain at least one
                                floating-point register. If it contains doubleword floating-point registers it must not contain more
                                than 16 floating-point registers.
