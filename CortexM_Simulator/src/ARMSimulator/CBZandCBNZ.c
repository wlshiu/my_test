            <label>               The label of the instruction that is to be branched to. The assembler calculates the required
                                  value of the offset from the PC value of the CB{N}Z instruction to this label, then selects an
                                  encoding that will set imm32 to that offset. Allowed offsets are even numbers in the range 0
                                  to 126.
