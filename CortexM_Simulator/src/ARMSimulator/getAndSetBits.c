 *       input value is 0b110101
 *
 *       The bit of the setTarget from 13 to 8 is set to 110101
 *
 *       Note* : if the range is larget than the input_value, the result maybe unexpected
 *
 *               eg Given higherRange is 16, lowerRange is 13 , range = 16-13+1 = 4 (+1 because of start from 0)
 *               If input_value is 0b10, which is need only need 2 bits to represent
 *               but it will overwrite the bit 16 to bit 13 by 0b0010 which is not what we want
 *               Special care needs to be taken when setting for the range
