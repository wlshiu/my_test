where:
          S           If present, specifies that the instruction updates the flags. Otherwise, the instruction does not
                      update the flags.

          <c><q>      See Standard assembler syntax fields on page A6-7.

          <Rd>        Specifies the destination register. If <Rd> is omitted, this register is the same as <Rn>.

          <Rn>        Specifies the register that contains the first operand.

          <Rm>        Specifies the register that is optionally shifted and used as the second operand.

          <shift>     Specifies the shift to apply to the value read from <Rm>. If <shift> is omitted, no shift is
                      applied. The possible shifts and how they are encoded are described in Shifts applied to a
                      register on page A6-12.
