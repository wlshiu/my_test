  t => type

where:
          S         If present, specifies that the instruction updates the flags. Otherwise, the instruction does not
                    update the flags.

          <c><q>    See Standard assembler syntax fields on page A6-7.

          <Rd>      Specifies the destination register. If <Rd> is omitted, this register is the same as <Rn>.

          <Rn>      Specifies the register that contains the first operand.

          <Rm>      Specifies the register that is optionally shifted and used as the second operand.

          <shift>   Specifies the shift to apply to the value read from <Rm>. If <shift> is omitted, no shift is
                    applied and both encodings are permitted. If <shift> is specified, only encoding T2 is
                    permitted. The possible shifts and how they are encoded are described in Shifts applied to a
                    register on page A6-12.

          A special case is that if EOR<c> <Rd>,<Rn>,<Rd> is written with <Rd> and <Rn> both in the range R0-R7, it will
          be assembled using encoding T2 as though EOR<c> <Rd>,<Rn> had been written. To prevent this happening,
          use the .W qualifier.
