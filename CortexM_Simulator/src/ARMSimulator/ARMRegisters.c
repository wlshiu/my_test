  [31]  N
        Negative or less than flag:
                                      1 = result negative
                                      0 = result positive.

  [30]  Z
        Zero flag:
                    1 = result of 0
                    0 = nonzero result.

  [29]  C   (unsigned overflow)
        Carry or borrow flag:
                                1 = carry true or borrow false
                                0 = carry false or borrow true.

  [28]  V   (signed overflow)
        Overflow flag:
                        1 = overflow
                        0 = no overflow.

  [24]  T     indicator to show whether in ARM/Thumb state, 1 for Thumb, 0 for ARM

  IT[7:5]     encodes the base condition (that is, the top 3 bits of the condition specified by the IT instruction) for
              the current IT block, if any. It contains 0b000 when no IT block is active.

  IT[4:0]     encodes the number of instructions that are due to be conditionally executed, and whether the
              condition for each is the base condition code or the inverse of the base condition code.
              It contains 0b00000 when no IT block is active.

  C, bit[29]                Carry condition code flag. Floating-point comparison operations update this flag.

  V, bit[28]                Overflow condition code flag. Floating-point comparison operations update this flag.

  Bit[27]                   Reserved.

  AHP, bit[26]              Alternative half-precision control bit:

                            1     Alternative half-precision format selected.

                            For more information see Floating-point half-precision formats on page A2-42.

  DN, bit[25]               Default NaN mode control bit:
                            0     NaN operands propagate through to the output of a floating-point operation.
                            1     Any operation involving one or more NaNs returns the Default NaN.

                            For more information, see NaN handling and the Default NaN on page A2-44.

  FZ, bit[24]               Flush-to-zero mode control bit:

                                  compliant with the IEEE 754 standard.
                            1     Flush-to-zero mode enabled.

                            For more information, see Flush-to-zero on page A2-43.

  RMode, bits[23:22]        Rounding Mode control field. The encoding of this field is:

                              0b11 Round towards Zero (RZ) mode.
                              The specified rounding mode is used by almost all floating-point instructions.

  Writes to the FPSCR can have side-effects on various aspects of processor operation. All of these side-effects are
  synchronous to the FPSCR write. This means they are guaranteed not to be visible to earlier instructions in the
  execution stream, and they are guaranteed to be visible to later instructions in the execution stream.
