            <Rn>              The base register. If it is the SP and ! is specified, the instruction is treated as described in
                              PUSH on page A6-188.

            !                 Causes the instruction to write a modified value back to <Rn>. Encoded as W = 1.
                              If ! is omitted, the instruction does not change <Rn>. Encoded as W = 0.

            <registers>       Is a list of one or more registers to be stored, separated by commas and surrounded by { and
                              }. The lowest-numbered register is stored to the lowest memory address, through to the
                              highest-numbered register to the highest memory address.
                              Encoding T1 does not support a list containing only one register. If an STMDB instruction with
                              just one register <Rt> in the list is assembled to Thumb, it is assembled to the equivalent
                              STR<c><q> <Rt>,[<Rn>,#-4]{!} instruction.
                              The SP and PC cannot be in the list.

                              1 if the operation fails to update memory.

            <Rt>              Specifies the source register.

            <Rn>              Specifies the base register. This register is allowed to be the SP.

            <imm>             Specifies the immediate offset added to the value of <Rn> to form the address. Allowed
                              values are multiples of 4 in the range 0-1020. <imm> can be omitted, meaning an offset of 0.
