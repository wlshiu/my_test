            <Rt>              Specifies the first source register.

            <Rt2>             Specifies the second source register.

            <Rn>              Specifies the base register. This register is allowed to be the SP.
                              +/- Is + or omitted to indicate that the immediate offset is added to the base register value
                              (add == TRUE), or – to indicate that the offset is to be subtracted (add == FALSE). Different
                              instructions are generated for #0 and #-0.

            <imm>             Specifies the immediate offset added to or subtracted from the value of <Rn> to form the
                              address. Allowed values are multiples of 4 in the range 0-1020. For the offset addressing
                              syntax, <imm> can be omitted, meaning an offset of 0.
