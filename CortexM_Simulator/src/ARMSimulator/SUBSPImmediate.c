where:
          S               If present, specifies that the instruction updates the flags. Otherwise, the instruction does not
                          update the flags.

          <c><q>          See Standard assembler syntax fields on page A6-7.

          <Rd>            Specifies the destination register. If <Rd> is omitted, this register is SP.

          <const>         Specifies the immediate value to be added to the value obtained from SP. Allowed values
                          are multiples of 4 in the range 0-508 for encoding T1 and any value in the range 0-4095 for
                          encoding T3. See Modified immediate constants in Thumb instructions on page A5-15 for
                          the range of allowed values for encoding T2.

          When both 32-bit encodings are available for an instruction, encoding T2 is preferred to
          encoding T3 (if encoding T3 is required, use the SUBW syntax).
