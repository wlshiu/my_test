/*Branch and Exchange

    BX<c> <Rm> Outside or last in IT block

  Branch and Exchange causes a branch to an address and instruction set specified by a register. ARMv7-M
  only supports the Thumb instruction set. An attempt to change the instruction execution state causes an
  exception

  For BX and BLX, bit[0] of Rm must be 1 for correct execution, but a branch occurs to the target
  address created by changing bit[0] to 0.
