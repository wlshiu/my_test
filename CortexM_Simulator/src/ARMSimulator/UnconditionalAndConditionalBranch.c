          Note
                        Encodings T1 and T3 are conditional in their own right, and do not require an IT instruction
                        to make them conditional.
                        For encodings T1 and T3, <c> is not allowed to be AL or omitted. The 4-bit encoding of the
                        condition is placed in the instruction and not in a preceding IT instruction, and the
                        instruction is not allowed to be in an IT block. As a result, encodings T1 and T2 are never
                        both available to the assembler, nor are encodings T3 and T4.

          <label>       Specifies the label of the instruction that is to be branched to. The assembler calculates the
                        required value of the offset from the PC value of the B instruction to this label, then selects
                        an encoding that will set imm32 to that offset.

          Allowed offsets are even numbers in the range -256 to 254 for encoding T1, -2048 to 2046
          for encoding T2, -1048576 to 1048574 for encoding T3, and -16777216 to 16777214 for
